# FAQs

### Great UX Design? 
Nope, I'm not a Soy Latte drinking, Sunset lovers.




### Did you use the latest, cutting edge, blazingly fast JS framework?
No, I just used HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I am big beginner, big noob. Noob use bone knife before marble knife.




### Is it practical or does it just work as a Proof of Concept?
It is merely a Proof Of Concept. I wanted to see if something like this could be built. Obviously there is a lot that would go into a production ready product but I was just curious.




### What do you use to store your financial data?
Local Storage. Yes, I know this is terrible for production. No, I don't care. 
This is a learning project, not a bank.




### Is your database secure?
Huh?




### Are there timestamps to track transactions in case of fraud?
Me no understand, me want different question.




### Are there anti-fraud/risk management mechanics?
Those are big words buddy, let's move this along.





### What inspired you to make this?
I don't have a PS5/gaming PC. It was this project or staring at paint dry on a wall...or reading the ingredients off of a chocolate cookie box.




### TODO (NOT IN ANY PARTICULAR ORDER)
1. Watch video on DOM Manipulation, as I have literally just been googling and failing my way forward, which is a painfully slow process.  ✅ Done...it felt like pulling my teeth out(17/09/2025)
2. Create an event listener for the transaction form submit button. ✅ Done! (12/09/2025)
3. Connect the information in the transaction form to the submit button. ✅ Done! (16/09/2025)
4. Have that information be updated in the 'Recent History' section of the Dash page. ✅ Done! It was a serious pain I will not lie. (04/10/2025)
5. Have that information be updated in the 'History' section of the History page.
6. Add a visibility option for the password. ✅ Done! (13/09/2025)
7. Watch a video on LocalStorage so that I can achieve TODO sections 4 and 3. ✅ Done! The video was too boring so I had to use Qwen and w3schools (19/09/2025)
8. Store the info succesively  ✅ Done! (22/09/2025)
9. Have the transactions actually affect the amount of money in my balance ✅ Done! (08/10/2025)

# Note from the developer:

I wanted to learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I also hate tutorial hell and tutorials of any kind. So I dedicated less than 2 months to building this dumpster fire of a project. Some engineer with 1+ years of experience could whip this up in a week and slap it in a PowerPoint presentation to show their Project Manager, but I am proud regardless, because this is the one project I genuinely commited to, and actually finished(technically). What started out as a simple 'I want to understand how HTML forms work, how is the user data processed? How is it validated? Where does it go? turned into this little eWallet Proof of Concept. I don't plan on changing anything right now, I might add the timestamp a little later when I'm rested. If you love it, great. If you hate it...same here bro, but I hate it with pride in my heart. If you hate it and believe you can do better, I encourage you to make something better. It would make me happy to know I lit a fire in one of you and got you to make something cool and significantly better. That's it from me man. Cheers.
