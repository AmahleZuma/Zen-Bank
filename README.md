3. Connect the information in the transaction form to the submit button. ✅ Done! (16/09/2025)
4. Have that information be updated in the 'Recent History' section of the Dash page. ✅ Done! It was a serious pain I will not lie. (04/10/2025)

6. Add a visibility option for the password. ✅ Done! (13/09/2025)
